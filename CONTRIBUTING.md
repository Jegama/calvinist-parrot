```

3. **Force push** your changes (since you've amended the commit):

```bash
git push -f origin mychange
```

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

To keep your fork up to date with the original repository:

1. **Fetch updates** from the upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

2. **Merge updates into your master branch**:

```bash
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

3. **Push updates to your fork**:

```bash
git push origin master
```

**Note:** Itâ€™s important to regularly sync your fork, especially before starting a new change.
