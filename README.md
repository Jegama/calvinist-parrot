# Calvinist Parrot

Brand new Calvinist Parrot! Now with 100% more TypeScript!

## Introduction

Calvinist Parrot is an AI-driven application that provides users with insights and interpretations of the Bible through the lens of Reformed theology.

This will be a shadow repo for now until I port enough of the OG features of the [Calvinist Parrot](https://github.com/Jegama/calvinist-parrot-legacy) to this new platform.

The idea is to deploy using Vercel, and manage the users and chat history using Appwrite.

## Features

- [x] Basic QA in landing page with the Counsel of 3
- [x] User authentication
- [ ] Basic chat functionality with Parrot and Calvin
- [ ] Devotionals
- [ ] CCEL Librarian
- [ ] Study Helper using BibleHub commentaries
- [ ] Main chat with the 3 agents Parrot, Calvin, and a CCEL Librarian, I concidered that it was better to keep it that way to ensure that the conversations are saved and can be retrieved later.
