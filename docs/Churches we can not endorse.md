# Churches We Can't Endorse

This document outlines various churches or movements that deny core Christian doctrines.

## Core doctrines

- The Trinity: We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
- The Gospel: We proclaim that salvation is secured by Christ’s historical death, burial, and resurrection on the third day, demonstrating His victory over sin and death.
- Justification by Faith: Individuals are justified solely by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, apart from works.
- The Deity and Humanity of Christ: We affirm that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man (Vera Deus, vera homo).
- The Authority of Scripture: The Bible is the inspired, inerrant, and infallible Word of God, serving as the ultimate authority in all matters of faith and practice.
- The Incarnation and Virgin Birth: We affirm that Jesus Christ took on human nature through miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit and was born of the Virgin Mary.
- The Atonement (Christ's Saving Work): Christ's sacrificial death on the cross is necessary and sufficient to reconcile sinners to God.
- The Resurrection: We affirm the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ, confirming His divinity and victory over sin and death.
- Christ's Return and Final Judgment: Jesus Christ will return personally and bodily to judge the living and the dead, culminating in the renewal of all things.
- The Character of God: God is holy, supreme, sovereign, immutable, faithful, good, patient, gracious, merciful, loving, and just; His wrath against sin is real.

## Non-Exhaustive List of Churches We Can't Endorse

### Roman Catholic
**Note:** Affirms inspiration/inerrancy and all classical Christological doctrines, but holds Scripture and Sacred Tradition together under the Magisterium and rejects sola fide.

**Denies:**
- Authority of Scripture as the *ultimate* authority (sola Scriptura)
- Justification by faith *alone* (sola fide)

### Eastern Orthodox
**Note:** Affirms inspiration, Trinity, virgin birth, bodily resurrection, return; emphasizes Holy Tradition and a synergistic/theotic view of salvation rather than Protestant sola fide.

**Denies:**
- Authority of Scripture as the *ultimate* authority (sola Scriptura)
- Justification by faith *alone* (monergistic, forensic sense)

### Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)
**Note:** Teaches a non-Nicene Godhead and qualifies biblical authority; also adds new canonical books.

**Denies:**
- Nicene doctrine of the Trinity (one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons)
- Scripture as sole/ultimate authority (adds other scriptures; Bible 'as far as correctly translated')

### Jehovah's Witnesses
**Note:** Affirm Jesus' resurrection in a spiritual (not bodily) sense and reject Nicene trinitarianism.

**Denies:**
- Trinity
- Full deity of Christ (teach Jesus is a created being/Michael)
- Bodily resurrection of Jesus (teach a spiritual resurrection)

### Christian Science
**Note:** Reinterprets sin, atonement, and resurrection in metaphysical terms; downplays/denies materiality.

**Denies:**
- Atonement as a once-for-all, substitutionary, objective work necessary/sufficient for reconciliation
- Bodily (material) categories in resurrection (interprets resurrection/atonement metaphysically)

### Oneness Pentecostalism (e.g., UPCI)
**Note:** Affirms Jesus' deity and resurrection but rejects three co-eternal Persons.

**Denies:**
- Trinity (holds 'Oneness'/modalism—one divine Person who manifests as Father/Son/Spirit)

### Christadelphians
**Note:** Non-trinitarian; teach Jesus is the Son of God but not co-eternal/consusbstantial with the Father.

**Denies:**
- Trinity
- Pre-existence and full deity of Christ

### Iglesia ni Cristo
**Note:** Strict monotheism identifying only the Father as true God; Jesus is a man exalted by God.

**Denies:**
- Trinity
- Full deity of Christ

### Unitarian Universalism / Unitarian churches
**Note:** Non-creedal movement; does not require affirmation of classical Christian dogmas.

- Full deity of Christ (varies; generally not required/affirmed)

### Swedenborgian / New Church
