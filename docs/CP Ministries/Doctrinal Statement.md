# Doctrinal Statement

Our theological foundation that guides all aspects of our ministry and partnerships.

## Core Doctrines

These core doctrines represent the foundational truths upon which Calvinist Parrot Ministries stands. We will not compromise on these essential beliefs:

- The Trinity: We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
- The Character of God: God is holy, supreme, sovereign, immutable, faithful, good, patient, gracious, merciful, loving, and just; His wrath against sin is real.
- The Authority of Scripture: The Bible is the inspired, inerrant, and infallible Word of God, serving as the ultimate authority in all matters of faith and practice.
- The Deity and Humanity of Christ: We affirm that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man (Vera Deus, vera homo).
- The Incarnation and Virgin Birth: We affirm that Jesus Christ took on human nature through miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit and was born of the Virgin Mary.
- The Atonement (Christ's Saving Work): Christ's sacrificial death on the cross is necessary and sufficient to reconcile sinners to God.
- The Gospel: We proclaim that salvation is secured by Christ’s historical death, burial, and resurrection on the third day, demonstrating His victory over sin and death.
- Justification by Faith: Individuals are justified solely by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, apart from works.
- The Resurrection: We affirm the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ, confirming His divinity and victory over sin and death.
- Christ's Return and Final Judgment: Jesus Christ will return personally and bodily to judge the living and the dead, culminating in the renewal of all things.

## Secondary Doctrines

Secondary doctrines are important but do not define Christian identity. Differences here may lead to denominational distinctions. Calvinist Parrot Ministries will respect and accommodate these differences in customized resources:

- Baptism: Mode and subjects of baptism (e.g., believer's baptism vs. infant baptism).
- Church Governance: Forms of church polity (congregational, presbyterian, episcopal).
- The Lord's Supper: Perspectives on Christ's presence in communion (symbolic, spiritual, real presence).
- Spiritual Gifts: Continuation or cessation of spiritual gifts.
- Role of Women in the Church: Complementarian or egalitarian views on women in leadership and ministry.
- Sanctification: Perspectives on the process and extent of sanctification.
- Continuity and Discontinuity: Relationship between Old and New Testaments (covenant theology, dispensationalism).
- Security of Salvation: Views on perseverance of the saints or loss of salvation.
- The Atonement (How it Works): Theories on Christ's atoning work (penal substitution, Christus Victor, moral influence).

## Tertiary Doctrines

Tertiary doctrines are less central and do not significantly impact unity or fellowship. Calvinist Parrot Ministries will maintain a neutral stance and encourage respectful discussion:

- Eschatology: Premillennialism, amillennialism, postmillennialism.
- Worship Style: Traditional versus contemporary worship preferences.
- Counseling Approaches: Biblical (nouthetic) counseling, biblical counseling, integrationist counseling.
- Creation: Interpretations of Genesis (young-earth, old-earth, theistic evolution).
- Christian Liberty: Personal convictions on disputable matters (diet, special days).
- Church Discipline: Approaches to practice and extent (formal, informal, excommunication).
- Parachurch Organizations: Role and function of external Christian ministries.
- Non-essential Doctrines: Varied interpretations of non-essential biblical passages.

## Commitment to Unity and Grace

In all doctrinal matters, Calvinist Parrot Ministries commits to uphold doctrinal integrity while engaging believers with humility, gentleness, and respect (1 Peter 3:15). We strive for unity in essential beliefs, liberty in non-essentials, and charity in all things.
