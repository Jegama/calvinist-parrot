# Ministry Partnership and Recommendation Policy

Our aim is to glorify Christ by freely sharing faithful, Gospel‑centered digital tools while partnering with churches and ministries that uphold historic Christian orthodoxy (Philippians 1:9–11; Ephesians 4:14–16). This policy outlines how we determine ministry partnerships and recommendations—it is platform‑agnostic and suitable for public distribution.

## 1. Foundations

We never compromise the core doctrines summarized in our Doctrinal Statement. We gladly cooperate across traditions that affirm the Gospel even where secondary differences remain (baptism, governance, gifts, worship style, covenant frameworks). We pursue unity in essentials, liberty in non‑essentials, and charity in all things (1 Peter 3:15; Romans 14:1–6).

## 2. Partnership & Recommendation Tiers

- **Confessional Reformed (Encouraged):** Public, explicit adoption of a historic Reformed confession (e.g., Westminster Standards, 1689 London Baptist, Three Forms of Unity) with clear Gospel articulation.
- **Gospel‑Aligned (Recommended):** Affirms all core doctrines and teaches in harmony with historic, orthodox Christianity; may not adopt a formal confession but exhibits clarity and fidelity.
- **Orthodox With Differences:** Affirms the essentials; holds secondary distinctives that differ from our Reformed heritage or lacks detailed published articulation. We note differences while honoring shared faith.
- **Clarity Pending:** Insufficient publicly available doctrinal clarity on essentials. We encourage direct inquiry rather than assumption.
- **Not Endorsed:** Clear denial of an essential doctrine or presence of a disqualifying concern (see Section 4).

Absence of content is treated as unknown, not denial. We do not infer doctrine beyond what is plainly published.

## 3. Core Partnership Criteria

We consider a ministry suitable for partnership when it:

1. Affirms every core doctrine: Trinity; character of God; authority of Scripture; deity and humanity of Christ; incarnation and virgin birth; atoning work; historical death, burial, resurrection; justification by grace through faith in Christ alone; bodily resurrection of Christ; personal return and final judgment.
2. Avoids explicit or structural denial of any essential (e.g., statements undermining Scripture’s authority or Christ’s unique mediatorship).
3. Is free from disqualifying critical concerns (Section 4).
4. Demonstrates commitment to the preaching and teaching of Scripture (2 Timothy 4:1–2).
5. Conducts worship and ministry in an orderly, biblically coherent manner (1 Corinthians 14:26–33).

## 4. Disqualifying Concerns

Published, unambiguous evidence of any of the following leads to “Not Endorsed” and disqualifies partnership:

- **Non‑Trinitarian:** Denial of one God in three persons (Matthew 28:19; John 1:1–3).
- **Denies Authority/Inerrancy of Scripture:** Rejects the Bible’s divine authority (2 Timothy 3:16–17; Psalm 19:7–9).
- **Works‑Based Justification:** Adds human merit as a condition for justification (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 3:28; Romans 4:5).
- **Universalism:** Asserts salvation for all apart from repentance and faith in Christ (John 14:6; Hebrews 9:27; Matthew 25:46).
- **Prosperity / Word of Faith:** Treats faith/giving as guarantee of health or wealth (1 Timothy 6:3–10; 2 Timothy 4:3–4).
- **Hyper‑Charismatic Excesses:** Manifestations or revelatory claims elevated above Scripture (1 Corinthians 14:26–33).
- **Entertainment‑Driven Worship:** Primary services reduced to performance/self‑help with diluted Gospel proclamation (2 Timothy 4:1–2; Colossians 3:16).
- **Ordained Women in Elder/Pastor Governing Offices:** Women serving in authoritative teaching/governing elder/pastor roles (1 Timothy 2:12; 1 Timothy 3:1–7; Titus 1:5–9).
- **LGBTQ Affirming (Marriage/Ordination/Membership Standards):** Affirmation of same‑sex marriage or leadership contrary to Scripture (Genesis 2:24; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9–11).
- **Open Theism:** Denial of God’s exhaustive foreknowledge (Isaiah 46:9–10; Psalm 139:1–6, 16).
- **New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) Claims:** Modern governing apostles with extra‑biblical authority (Hebrews 1:1–2; Jude 3).
- **Progressive Christianity Doctrinal Revisions:** Rejection of substitutionary atonement or binding biblical authority (Isaiah 53:4–6; Romans 3:25; John 10:35).
- **Religious Pluralism:** Multiple salvific paths affirmed (Acts 4:12; John 14:6).

Evidence must come from official publications (statement of faith, doctrinal pages, leadership bios, formal teaching summaries). Isolated ambiguous phrases are not treated as conclusive.

## 5. Information Gaps

Where essentials are not clearly published, we pause endorsement and mark “Clarity Pending” rather than assuming denial. Lack of a statement of faith alone does not disqualify; we seek clarification in good faith.

## 6. Correction & Reassessment

If a ministry believes our classification is inaccurate, it may submit:

- URLs containing clarifying or updated doctrinal material.
- Concise summary of the correction.
- Documentation of confession adoption (if applicable).

Upon verification, we update status; removal of disqualifying content and affirmation of essentials can restore partnership (Proverbs 12:17; Ephesians 4:15).

## 7. Stewardship & Revision

We periodically review this policy to ensure clarity and fidelity. Revisions retain all core doctrinal commitments while refining language for transparency.

## 8. Summary

We champion Gospel faithfulness across orthodox traditions, exercising careful discernment where doctrine is distorted or unclear. Our stance is protective, pastoral, and principled—never punitive. Freely we have received; freely we give (Matthew 10:8). Soli Deo Gloria (Romans 11:36).
