## **4. Key Brand Messaging Pillars**

### **a. Faithfulness**
We echo Scripture, not human opinion. Like a parrot, we repeat what our Master says—faithfully, clearly, and unashamedly.

### **b. Freedom**
Every tool we build is a gift. No subscriptions. No trials. No fine print. The Gospel is free—so are our resources.

### **c. Fellowship**
We serve the Church—not a denomination. While rooted in Reformed theology, we partner across traditions that affirm the Gospel of grace.

### **d. Futurism**
We embrace technology—not as a gimmick, but as a means of proclaiming eternal truth in new languages, mediums, and nations.
