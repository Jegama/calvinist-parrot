## Secondary Doctrines by Confession

Below, for each secondary doctrine, I list where each confession explicitly (or in a few cases, by necessary implication) teaches that position. When multiple documents form one standard (e.g. Belgic + Heidelberg + Dort), I'll reference whichever component is clearest.

### 1. **Baptism**
* **Westminster Confession of Faith (1646/47)**:
  WCF 28.4 teaches that baptism is for “not only those that do actually profess faith… but also the infants of one or both believing parents,” indicating infant baptism.
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)**:
  2LBCF 29.2 restricts baptism to “those who do actually profess repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,” and 29.4 defines baptism as immersion (“dipping of the person in water”).
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Belgic Confession Art. 34 teaches that children of believers “ought to be baptized and sealed with the sign of the covenant.” Heidelberg Catechism Q.74: infants, as well as adults, belong to God's covenant and therefore must be baptized.
* **Second Helvetic Confession (1566)**:
  Second Helvetic ch. 20 (“Of Holy Baptism”) affirms baptism of infants of the faithful as proper and rebukes Anabaptist rejection of infant baptism.
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  Irish Articles §§94–95 (numbering varies by edition) affirm that baptism is to be administered to “the infants of the faithful,” showing paedobaptism.
* **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  Savoy ch. 29 substantially mirrors Westminster ch. 28, including baptism of “the infants of one or both believing parents.”

### 2. **Governance**

* **Westminster Confession of Faith**:
  WCF 30–31 describes the authority of church officers and of “synods and councils” for appeals and discipline. This assumes a graded eldership (session/presbytery/synod), i.e. presbyterian polity.
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)**:
  2LBCF 26 (“Of the Church”) teaches that each local congregation is ruled by qualified elders/bishops and deacons, with cooperation among churches but without binding courts above the congregation → elder-led congregational.
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Belgic Confession Arts. 30–32 lay out ministers, elders, and deacons, and the lawful order of discipline in assemblies. This is historically exercised in presbyterial/synodical structures in the Reformed churches. Canons of Dort themselves were issued by an international synod, reflecting presbyterian-style assemblies.
* **Second Helvetic Confession**:
  Second Helvetic chs. 17–18 (“Of the Church,” “Of the Ministers of the Church”) describe pastors/elders and synods for settling doctrine, aligning with presbyterian/synodical governance rather than independent congregationalism or bishops as a separate order.
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  The Irish Articles were framed for the Church of Ireland, which retained bishops. They speak of bishops, pastors, and ministers as distinct offices in a continuing episcopal structure. (Articles ~70–71 in common numbering.)
* **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  Savoy ch. 26 (“Of the Church”) explicitly modifies Westminster to assert the autonomy of each gathered congregation under its own elders, while allowing synods for counsel but not jurisdiction. That's classic Congregationalism → elder-led congregational.

### 3. **Lord's Supper**

All six teach what's usually called **Reformed “spiritual presence”**:
Christ is not physically/corporeally present in/under/with the elements, but believers truly feed on Christ by faith through the Holy Spirit.

* **Westminster Confession of Faith**:
  WCF 29.7–8: worthy receivers “do then spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ crucified… by faith,” yet “the body and blood of Christ are… spiritually present.”
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)**:
  2LBCF 30.7–8 repeats Westminster/Savoy language: communicants “spiritually receive and feed upon Christ.”
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Belgic Confession Art. 35: believers “do not receive this [the Supper] as common and ordinary bread… but… by faith… partake of the true body and true blood of Christ” while rejecting transubstantiation. Heidelberg Catechism Q.75–79 likewise.
* **Second Helvetic Confession**:
  Second Helvetic ch. 21: Christ is truly offered to believers, yet “we do not so much eat him corporally… as spiritually by faith.”
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  Irish Articles §§100ff reject transubstantiation and teach that the faithful spiritually receive Christ in the Supper.
* **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  Savoy ch. 30 follows Westminster's articulation of spiritual feeding on Christ by faith, not carnal/physical manducation.

### 4. **Gifts (extraordinary / revelatory gifts)**

All six land in what we're calling **“cessationist”**: public revelation is closed, and the “extraordinary” offices/gifts that delivered new revelation are no longer ongoing.

* **Westminster Confession of Faith**:
  WCF 1.1 says God “at sundry times and in divers manners… revealed himself… unto the Church; and afterwards… committed [it] wholly unto writing… those former ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.”
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)** / **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  2LBCF 1.1 and Savoy 1.1 reproduce Westminster 1.1 almost verbatim (sometimes with minor wording changes), including that “former ways of God's revealing his will… are now ceased.”
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Belgic Confession Art. 7: Scripture is sufficient, so “it is unlawful for anyone… to teach otherwise than we are now taught in the Holy Scriptures”; divine revelation is complete. Canons of Dort I & V assume the sufficiency and finality of Scripture, not ongoing apostles/prophets.
* **Second Helvetic Confession**:
  Second Helvetic ch. 1 (“Of the Holy Scripture”) calls Scripture “the true Word of God,” the rule of faith to which nothing is to be added—functionally closing canon and ruling out continuing revelatory offices.
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  Irish Articles §§1–5 assert Scripture alone as the final, sufficient rule of faith and life, displacing any supposed continuing revelations.

### 5. **Women in Church**

All six define ordained church offices (pastor/minister/bishop/elder) in explicitly male terms and tie qualifications to 1 Timothy 3 / Titus 1 (“husband of one wife”), which implies what we now call **complementarian** (no female ministers/elders).

* **Westminster Confession of Faith**:
  WCF 30–31 discusses “church censures” exercised by church officers and cites 1 Tim. 3 / Titus 1 for qualifications, which are male-coded (“husband of one wife”).
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)**:
  2LBCF 26.8–10 describes “bishops or elders” and “deacons,” again referencing 1 Tim. 3 for qualifications; historically understood as male elders.
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Belgic Confession Arts. 30–31: Christ appoints “ministers or pastors,” “elders,” and “deacons,” with qualifications drawn from the pastoral epistles, which they interpret male.
* **Second Helvetic Confession**:
  Second Helvetic ch. 18 describes ministers of the Word as those rightly called to preach and administer sacraments, drawing on passages historically applied to qualified men.
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  Articles ~70–71 refer to bishops, pastors, and ministers, all in male terms.
* **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  Savoy ch. 26 mirrors Westminster but within Congregational polity, again grounding elder qualifications in 1 Tim. 3 / Titus 1.

### 6. **Sanctification**

All six teach both (a) definitive union with Christ and (b) ongoing mortification of sin and growth in holiness. That maps best to **“positional & progressive.”**

* **Westminster Confession of Faith**:
  WCF 13 (“Of Sanctification”): those effectually called “are further sanctified… through the virtue of Christ's death and resurrection… the dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed… and they more and more quickened and strengthened.”
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)**:
  2LBCF 13 reproduces Westminster 13 with Baptist wording.
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Belgic Confession Art. 24: true faith “regenerates” a person so they “may live a new life,” yet believers still struggle with sin. Heidelberg Catechism Q.88–90 describes the two-part rhythm of sanctification: “the dying of the old man” and “the making alive of the new.”
* **Second Helvetic Confession**:
  Second Helvetic ch. 16–17 (“Of Faith and Good Works,” “Of the Church of Christ”) teaches believers are justified and then truly renewed in good works, battling sin in this life.
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  Irish Articles §§33–36 (on justification, sanctification, good works) teach that those justified are renewed in holiness yet continue to war against sin in this life.
* **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  Savoy ch. 13 (“Of Sanctification”) is again the Westminster doctrine.

### 7. **Continuity (Covenant Theology vs Dispensationalism)**

All six teach a single, unfolding plan of redemption administered through covenants. None teach classic modern dispensationalism. So: **“covenant theology.”**

* **Westminster Confession of Faith**:
  WCF 7 distinguishes the Covenant of Works with Adam and the Covenant of Grace revealed progressively and administered under both Old and New Testaments.
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)**:
  2LBCF 7 affirms one Covenant of Grace in Christ, though Baptists describe its administration with more “new covenant” specificity than Westminster. Still covenantal, not dispensational.
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Belgic Confession Art. 34 treats baptism as the covenant sign replacing circumcision, showing continuity of God's covenant people and promises. Canons of Dort I & II assume one eternal decree of election and one people redeemed in Christ.
* **Second Helvetic Confession**:
  Second Helvetic ch. 12 (“Of the Law of God”) and ch. 20 (“Of Holy Baptism”) see the church as the continuation of God's covenant people, with sacraments as covenant signs.
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  Irish Articles §§33–37 unfold redemption in terms of God's eternal decree and covenant mercy through Christ across the testaments; they are widely recognized as a forerunner to Westminster's covenant theology.
* **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  Savoy ch. 7 keeps Westminster's covenant theology within Congregational polity.

### 8. **Security**

All six confess **perseverance of the saints**: those truly regenerated/elect will finally persevere.

* **Westminster Confession of Faith**:
  WCF 17 (“Of the Perseverance of the Saints”): those effectually called and sanctified “can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace.”
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)**:
  2LBCF 17 mirrors WCF 17: the elect “shall certainly persevere therein to the end, and be eternally saved.”
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Canons of Dort, Fifth Head of Doctrine, explicitly defend the certain preservation of the regenerate against the Remonstrants. This is the classic Reformed articulation of perseverance.
* **Second Helvetic Confession**:
  Second Helvetic ch. 10 (“Of the Predestination of God and the Election of the Saints”) teaches that the elect are chosen unto salvation and God preserves them; true believers are assured that God will sustain them to the end.
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  Irish Articles (often Art. 94 or nearby in numbered editions) explicitly teach election and the final perseverance of the elect, anticipating Dort/Westminster on this point.
* **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  Savoy ch. 17 keeps Westminster's doctrine of perseverance intact.

### 9. **Atonement Model**

All six teach that Christ, as substitute for His people, satisfied divine justice by bearing their guilt and punishment. This is classic **penal substitution** (while not denying other aspects like victory over death/Satan).

* **Westminster Confession of Faith**:
  WCF 8.5 calls Christ the “surety” who “fully satisfied the justice of his Father,” and WCF 11.3 says His obedience and satisfaction are imputed to believers.
* **Second London Baptist Confession (1689)**:
  2LBCF 8.4–5, 11.1–3 repeats Westminster's structure: Christ, as Mediator and surety, by His obedience and death “discharged our debt.”
* **Belgic / Heidelberg / Dort**:
  Belgic Confession Arts. 20–21: God made Christ “to bear the punishment of sin by his most bitter passion and death,” satisfying God's justice. Heidelberg Catechism Q.12–18 teaches we owe satisfaction to God's justice, which only Christ, our Mediator, can pay. Canons of Dort II.1–2: Christ's death was a satisfaction of divine justice for the elect.
* **Second Helvetic Confession**:
  Second Helvetic ch. 11 teaches Christ offered Himself as the only sacrifice for sin, reconciling us to the Father by His death.
* **Irish Articles (1615)**:
  Irish Articles ~31 teach that Christ, by His obedience and sacrifice, made “a full, perfect, and sufficient satisfaction for all the sins of the elect,” overtly substitutionary/penal language.
* **Savoy Declaration (1658)**:
  Savoy ch. 8 and ch. 11 keep Westminster's language: Christ, as Mediator, satisfies divine justice on behalf of the elect, whose guilt and punishment He bears.
