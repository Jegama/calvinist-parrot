export const DENOMINATION_CONFESSION_PROMPT = `${COMMON_RULES}

### Task: Identify Denomination, Confession, and Structural Characteristics

**Denomination:**
- \`label\`: Best guess of denomination (e.g., "Reformed Baptist", "Presbyterian (PCA)", "Lutheran (LCMS)", "Anglican", "Non-denominational", etc.)
- \`confidence\`: 0.0 to 1.0 (how confident are you?)
- \`signals\`: Array of short reasons (e.g., ["credo-baptism", "elder-led", "WCF referenced"])

**Confession:**
Determine if the church **adopts** a historic confession as their doctrinal standard.

- \`adopted\`: \`true\` if they say things like:
  - "Our confession of faith is..."
  - "We adopt the [confession name]"
  - "For a fuller summation of our doctrinal basis, see/read/refer to the [confession name]"
  - "We hold to the [confession name] as our doctrinal standard"
  - "We subscribe to the [confession name]"
  - "[Confession] contains an excellent expression of our faith"
  - "To understand our beliefs more deeply, see the [confession name]"
  - "We encourage you to read the [confession name]" (when paired with "doctrinal basis")
  
**KEY INDICATOR**: If the confession is presented as the **fuller/complete statement** of their beliefs (not just a helpful resource), mark \`adopted = true\`.
  
- \`adopted\`: \`false\` if they only **casually reference** or say "generally in agreement with" but don't present it as their doctrinal standard

- \`name\`: Name of the confession (e.g., "Westminster Confession of Faith (1646/47)", "Second London Baptist Confession (1689)")

- Second Helvetic Confession (1566)
- Irish Articles (1615)
- Savoy Declaration (1658)

**Notes:**
If \`adopted = true\`, add a note:

- **üèüÔ∏è Megachurch**: If stated membership/attendance is over 2000

Only add badges you have clear evidence for. Return empty array if none apply.`;

// ============================================================================
// Call 6: Red Flags & Final Analysis Prompt
// ============================================================================
export const RED_FLAGS_PROMPT = `${COMMON_RULES}

### Task: Detect Red Flags & Concerning Theological Indicators

Review all website content for the following red flag indicators. Add badges ONLY if you have clear evidence:

### Red Flag Badges:

**‚ö†Ô∏è Prosperity Gospel**: 
- Word of Faith theology
- Health and wealth emphasis
- "Seed faith" / "name it and claim it"
- Guaranteed physical/financial blessing for faith/giving
- Teachers: Osteen, Copeland, Dollar, Hinn, Meyer (if heavily referenced)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Hyper-Charismatic**: 
- Excessive focus on manifestations
- "Drunk in the Spirit", "holy laughter", "grave soaking"
- Gold dust, angel feathers, or other physical signs emphasized
- Prophecy/tongues elevated above Scripture
- Apostolic/prophetic movements (NAR - New Apostolic Reformation)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Entertainment-Driven**: 
- Church marketed primarily as entertainment venue
- Diluted or absent gospel presentation
- Sermons focus on self-help rather than Scripture
- Heavy emphasis on production/performance over worship
- "Seeker-driven" model where biblical content is minimized to attract crowds

**üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà LGBTQ Affirming**: 
Look for explicit affirmation in these contexts:
- **Membership**: "We welcome LGBTQ individuals into full membership"
- **Ordination**: LGBTQ individuals can serve as pastors/elders
- **Marriage**: Church performs/blesses same-sex marriages
- **Denominational policy**: Affiliated with denomination that permits these (and church doesn't disclaim it)

**Important**: Generic welcoming language like "all are welcome" is NOT sufficient. You need explicit inclusion in membership, leadership, or marriage contexts.

**Also check for**: Women serving as "pastors" or "elders" (not just staff or deacons).

### Notes:
For each red flag badge you add, create a note with:
- \`label\`: Name of the badge (e.g., "Prosperity Gospel", "LGBTQ Affirming")
- \`text\`: Brief explanation of what you found (‚â§50 words)
- \`source_url\`: URL where you found this evidence

If NO red flags are found, return empty arrays for both badges and notes.`;
