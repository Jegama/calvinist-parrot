These doctrines are important but do not define Christian identity. Differences here may lead to denominational distinctions. We respect and accommodate these differences.

### 1. **Baptism** (\`baptism\`)

**Definition**: The mode (how) and subjects (who) of baptism.

**Common positions:**
- **Believer's baptism by immersion**: Only those who profess faith are baptized; mode is full immersion
- **Infant baptism (paedobaptism)**: Covenant children of believers are baptized; mode may be sprinkling, pouring, or immersion
- **Both infant & believer's baptism**: Some churches practice both (rare)

**What to look for:**
- Check for explicit statements: "We baptize believers", "We practice infant baptism", "Baptism is for believers and their children"
- Look for clues: "Credo-baptism" = believer's, "Paedo-baptism" = infant
- Mode clues: "Immersion", "sprinkling", "pouring", "by water"

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Believer's baptism by immersion"
- "Infant baptism (paedo)"
- "Both infant & believer's"
- "Infant baptism, mode unclear"
- "Ambiguous/not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- If they say "baptism" without specifying, check denomination (Baptist = believer's, Presbyterian = infant)
- "Covenant baptism" usually = infant baptism

---

### 2. **Church Governance** (\`governance\`)

**Definition**: The structure and authority model for church leadership and decision-making.

**Common positions:**
- **Congregational**: Congregation votes on major decisions; elders/pastors lead but congregation has final authority
- **Presbyterian**: Elders govern; local church is accountable to presbytery (regional body of elders)
- **Episcopal**: Bishops govern multiple churches; hierarchical structure
- **Elder-led congregational**: Elders have primary authority, congregation has some input (hybrid model)

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Congregational governance", "Elder-led", "Presbyterian polity", "Episcopalian", "Bishop-led"
- Look for: "Members vote on...", "Accountable to presbytery", "Led by elders", "Bishop oversees"

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Elder-led congregational"
- "Presbyterian"
- "Episcopal"
- "Congregational"
- "Elder plurality"
- "Ambiguous/not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- Many churches have elder plurality but differ on congregational authority
- "Elder-led" alone doesn't clarify if congregational or presbyterian—look for accountability structure

### 3. **The Lord's Supper** (\`lords_supper\`)

**Definition**: The nature of Christ's presence in communion and its purpose.

**Common positions:**
- **Memorial view** (Zwinglian): A symbolic remembrance; bread and wine represent Christ's body and blood
- **Spiritual presence** (Calvinist): Christ is spiritually present; believers feed on Christ by faith
- **Real presence / Sacramental union** (Lutheran): Christ's body and blood are truly present "in, with, and under" the elements
- **Transubstantiation** (Roman Catholic): Elements become Christ's actual body and blood

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Remembrance", "memorial", "spiritual presence", "real presence", "sacrament", "ordinance"
- "Ordinance" (Baptist) usually = memorial view
- "Sacrament" (Reformed/Lutheran) usually = spiritual or real presence

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Memorial"
- "Spiritual presence"
- "Real presence / sacramental union"
- "Sacramental"
- "Ambiguous/not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- Most Protestant churches reject transubstantiation—don't assume it unless explicitly Roman Catholic
- "We partake of Christ in communion" could be spiritual presence (mark as such if Reformed/Presbyterian)

### 4. **Spiritual Gifts** (\`gifts\`)

**Definition**: Whether certain miraculous gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing) continue today or ceased after the apostolic age.

**Common positions:**
- **Cessationist**: Miraculous gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing) ceased with the apostles or completion of Scripture
- **Cautious continuationist**: Gifts continue but are not normative; practiced with restraint and biblical testing
- **Continuationist/Charismatic**: Gifts continue and are normative for the church; expected in ministry

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Cessationist", "gifts ceased", "all gifts continue", "spiritual gifts are for today", "tongues and prophecy"
- Charismatic indicators: Emphasis on tongues, prophecy, healing ministries, "Spirit-filled"

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Cessationist"
- "Cautious continuationist"
- "Continuationist"
- "Charismatic"
- "Ambiguous/not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- If they say "we believe in the Holy Spirit's work" but don't mention specific gifts, mark \`ambiguous\`
- Pentecostal churches are typically charismatic continuationists

---

### 5. **Role of Women in the Church** (\`women_in_church\`)

**Definition**: Whether women can serve in teaching and governing roles (pastor/elder).

**Common positions:**
- **Complementarian**: Men and women have equal value but distinct roles; women should not serve as pastors/elders but may serve in other ministries (teaching women/children, deaconesses, etc.)
- **Egalitarian**: Men and women can serve in all roles, including pastor/elder, without restriction

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Complementarian", "egalitarian", "male leadership", "women pastors", "women elders"
- Look at leadership page: Are there women serving as pastors/elders? (If yes = likely egalitarian)
- "Biblical manhood and womanhood" usually = complementarian

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Complementarian"
- "Egalitarian"
- "Male eldership"
- "Women in pastoral leadership"
- "Varies/unclear"

**Edge cases:**
- Women serving as deacons does NOT = egalitarian (complementarians often affirm female deacons)
- Women teaching women/children does NOT = egalitarian
- Only mark egalitarian if women serve as pastors/elders or church explicitly affirms it

---

### 6. **Sanctification** (\`sanctification\`)

**Definition**: The process and extent of spiritual growth and holiness in the Christian life.

**Common positions:**
- **Progressive sanctification**: Gradual growth in holiness throughout life; perfection not attained until glorification
- **Entire sanctification / Christian perfection** (Wesleyan): Believers can attain a "second blessing" of perfect love in this life
- **Positional & progressive**: Believers are already sanctified (set apart) in Christ and also grow in practical holiness

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Progressive sanctification", "growing in holiness", "entire sanctification", "Christian perfection", "sinless perfection"
- Wesleyan/Methodist churches often teach entire sanctification
- Reformed churches typically teach progressive sanctification

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Progressive"
- "Entire sanctification"
- "Positional & progressive"
- "Ambiguous/not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- Most churches teach some form of progressive sanctification—only mark "entire sanctification" if explicitly Wesleyan/Holiness language

---

### 7. **Continuity and Discontinuity** (\`continuity\`)

**Definition**: The relationship between Old and New Testaments, particularly regarding the covenants and Israel/Church.

**Common positions:**
- **Covenant theology**: One covenant of grace across OT/NT; church is the continuation of Israel; emphasis on continuity (supports paedobaptism)
- **Dispensationalism**: God has different administrations (dispensations) throughout history; distinction between Israel and the Church; emphasis on discontinuity
- **New covenant theology**: Believer's baptism, but not fully dispensational; sees Mosaic covenant as fulfilled in Christ

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Covenant theology", "dispensational", "new covenant theology", "one covenant of grace"
- Presbyterian/Reformed = typically covenant theology
- Baptist = could be covenant theology or dispensational
- Credobaptist + Reformed soteriology = possibly new covenant theology

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Covenant theology"
- "Dispensationalism"
- "New covenant theology"
- "Mixed/unclear"
- "Ambiguous/not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- This doctrine is rarely stated explicitly—infer from baptism view + theological tradition when possible

### 8. **Security of Salvation** (\`security\`)

**Definition**: Whether believers can lose their salvation or are eternally secure in Christ.

**Common positions:**
- **Perseverance of the saints** (Reformed): True believers are eternally secure and will persevere in faith; they cannot lose salvation
- **Conditional security** (Arminian): Believers can lose salvation through apostasy or willful sin
- **Eternal security** (some Baptist): "Once saved, always saved" (may not emphasize perseverance)

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Perseverance of the saints", "eternal security", "cannot lose salvation", "conditional security", "apostasy"
- Reformed churches typically teach perseverance of the saints
- Arminian churches (Methodist, Nazarene, some Baptist) typically teach conditional security

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Perseverance of the saints"
- "Eternal security"
- "Conditional security"
- "Mixed/unclear"
- "Ambiguous/not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- "Assurance of salvation" is NOT the same as eternal security—assurance is about knowing you're saved, not whether you can lose it
- "God preserves His elect" = perseverance of the saints

---

### 9. **The Atonement (How it Works)** (\`atonement_model\`)

**Definition**: Theories explaining how Christ's death accomplishes salvation.

**Common positions:**
- **Penal substitution**: Christ bore the penalty/punishment for sin in our place; satisfied God's wrath
- **Christus Victor**: Christ's death defeated Satan, sin, and death; liberation from bondage
- **Moral influence** (liberal): Christ's death demonstrates God's love; inspires moral change (often heterodox)
- **Ransom theory**: Christ's death paid a ransom to Satan (historical view, less common today)
- **Governmental theory**: Christ's death upholds God's moral government (Arminian view)

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Penal substitution", "substitutionary atonement", "propitiation", "Christus Victor", "ransom", "moral influence"
- Most evangelical churches affirm penal substitution (even if not by name)
- "Bore our sins", "died in our place", "satisfied God's wrath" = penal substitution

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Penal substitution"
- "Christus Victor"
- "Multiple models affirmed"
- "Substitutionary atonement (unspecified)"
- "Ambiguous/not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- Many churches hold multiple models (e.g., penal substitution + Christus Victor)—list primary emphasis if clear
- Moral influence alone (without substitution) is heterodox—mark as red flag if this is the only view`;
