### 1. **Eschatology** (\`eschatology\`)

**Definition**: Views on the end times, particularly the millennium (1000-year reign of Christ in Revelation 20).

**Common positions:**
- **Amillennialism**: The millennium is symbolic of the current church age; Christ reigns spiritually now; no literal 1000-year earthly reign
- **Premillennialism**: Christ will return before the millennium to establish His earthly kingdom for 1000 years
- **Postmillennialism**: The gospel will gradually transform the world; Christ returns after the millennium (a golden age of the church)
- **Premillennial dispensational**: Specific form of premillennialism with pre-tribulation rapture, distinction between Israel and church

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Amillennial", "premillennial", "postmillennial", "rapture", "tribulation", "millennium"
- Most Reformed/Presbyterian = amillennial or postmillennial
- Many Baptist/evangelical = premillennial
- Dispensational churches emphasize rapture and tribulation timeline

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Amillennial"
- "Premillennial"
- "Postmillennial"
- "Premillennial dispensational"
- "Mixed/unclear"
- "Not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- Many churches don't specify eschatology—mark \`not stated\` if unclear

**What to look for:**

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Traditional"
- "Contemporary"

### 3. **Counseling Approaches** (\`counseling\`)

**Definition**: The church's approach to counseling and addressing mental/emotional struggles.

**Common positions:**
- **Nouthetic counseling** (biblical counseling, Jay Adams): Scripture alone is sufficient; problem is sin; change through repentance and obedience
- **Biblical counseling** (integrative biblical): Scripture is primary but may use insights from psychology/medicine when compatible
- **Integrationist**: Integrates psychology and theology; may refer to licensed therapists
- **Professional referral**: Church refers members to professional counselors/therapists

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Biblical counseling", "nouthetic counseling", "licensed counselors", "professional counseling", "pastoral care"
- ACBC/IABC certification = biblical counseling (often nouthetic)

**Neutral phrases to use:**

### 4. **Creation** (\`creation\`)

**Definition**: Interpretation of Genesis 1-2 regarding the age of the earth and method of creation.

**Common positions:**
- **Young-earth creationism** (YEC): Earth is ~6,000-10,000 years old; six literal 24-hour days of creation
- **Old-earth creationism** (OEC): Earth is billions of years old; "days" may be ages or literary framework
- **Theistic evolution** (evolutionary creationism): God used evolutionary processes to create; Genesis is theological, not scientific
- **Framework hypothesis**: Genesis 1 is a literary framework, not chronological; agnostic on age

**What to look for:**
- Check for: "Six-day creation", "young earth", "old earth", "theistic evolution", "evolutionary creationism", "framework view"
- "Literal six days" = young-earth
- "God created over long periods" = old-earth
- Acceptance of evolution = theistic evolution

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Young-earth"
- "Old-earth"
- "Theistic evolution"
- "Framework hypothesis"
- "Not stated"

**Edge cases:**

**What to look for:**

- **Selective partnership**: Partners with some parachurch organizations but not others (based on theology)

**What to look for:**

- "We support..." followed by parachurch names = supports parachurch
- Lack of partnerships may indicate church-only focus (but could just be unlisted)

**Neutral phrases to use:**
- "Supports parachurch ministries"
- "Church-only focus"
- "Selective partnership"
- "Not stated"

**Edge cases:**
- Most churches don't explicitly address parachurch philosophy—mark \`not stated\` unless clear

- If they explicitly use terms like "biblical patriarchy" or "patriarchal" to describe family order, mark "Patriarchal"
- Statements only about the definition of marriage (e.g., "between one man and one woman") without role details → "Not stated"
