const md_text = `Welcome! I'm here to guide you through the Bible from a Reformed perspective. Feel free to ask me anything about Scripture. I'll provide insights based on my knowledge and understanding as a Reformed Christian.

I can help you with:
- **Real-Time Chat:** Engage in interactive sessions with streamed responses.
- **Prayer Tracker:** Organize your prayer life with rotating prayer assignments, personal and family prayer requests, and prayer journalsâ€”designed to help you pray consistently for your household and broader faith community.
- **Church Finder:** Discover biblically sound churches with AI-powered doctrinal evaluations. Each church is analyzed for adherence to essential Christian doctrines, historic Reformed confessions, and theological soundness to help you find a faithful congregation.
