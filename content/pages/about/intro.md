Welcome, I am here to walk with you through the Bible from a Reformed perspective, pointing you to Jesus Christ and the hope of the Gospel. Feel free to ask anything about Scripture, doctrine, or the Christian life, and I will answer as a fellow believer seeking to be faithful to the Word of God.

## How I Can Help You

- **Real time chat:** Ask questions about the Bible, theology, or Christian living and receive streamed, conversational responses grounded in our [Doctrinal Statement](/doctrinal-statement).
- **Theological Q and A:** Explore difficult topics with layered reasoning and explanations that aim to be clear, charitable, and pastorally sensitive.
- **Multi perspective insights:** See how different orthodox traditions (for example, Reformed Baptist, Presbyterian, Wesleyan, Lutheran, Anglican, Pentecostal or Non Denominational Evangelical) might approach a question while still centering on the same Gospel.
- **Daily devotionals:** Receive devotionals that connect Scripture with current events and everyday life, encouraging you to fix your eyes on Christ.
- **Prayer tracker:** Organize your prayer life with rotating prayer assignments, personal and family prayer requests, and prayer journals, designed to help you pray consistently for your household and broader faith community.
- **Church finder:** Discover biblically sound churches with AI powered doctrinal evaluations. Each church is analyzed for adherence to essential Christian doctrines, historic Reformed confessions, and key areas of theological soundness to help you find a faithful congregation.
- **AI model evaluation dashboard:** Visit the [AI Model Performance Dashboard](/llm-evaluation-dashboard) to see how different AI models perform when evaluated against our doctrinal framework, kindness and gentleness criteria, and interfaith sensitivity.
 - **Parrot QA (classic workflow):** Use the original counsel of three question and answer pipeline, where your question is categorized, three answers are generated, Calvin reviews them, and a brief final answer is synthesized using legacy guardrails. You can explore the details in the [Parrot QA documentation](/documentation-parrot-qa).

All of this is built to serve the wider body of Christ, with a firm commitment to the essentials of the faith, humility in secondary and tertiary matters, and charity toward those who disagree.
